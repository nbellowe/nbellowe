# Hi! My name is Nathan Bellowe.
I'm a Junior Computer Science student at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

Below is a copied and pasted section of my resume, which gives you some idea of my professional/academic background.

Profile
===

I’m diplomatic, professional able to work with people of all levels, can follow specific directions, and work individually or cooperatively. I am flexible and versatile – and flourish under pressure. Once I’m interested in something, I can’t put it down, and work hard to accomplish it. Point me at something interesting, and I'll provide the passion, knowledge, and elbow grease to get it done.

Experience
===

Windward Studios	December 2013 - Present
---
My responsibilities at Windward included (in order from most recent):  

- (Last 1 year+) Working on the development of a online "Microsoft Word" type editor with built in reporting capabilities. I was in charge of the UI and view, and helping with the applications architecture. I became the "tools" guy for this project, ranging from NodeJS and grunt for a complex build, utilizing requireJS's optimizer, uglifyJS for conditional compilation, mocha for testing, etc.

- Building a "sample code" generator, looking at template’s metadata to determine the sample code in various languages in order to run the template through the “Windward Engine”.

- Various other tasks using Java, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Visual Studio, complex development builds, setting up testing processes, and helping new employees learn the ropes. The 20 or so months I have been working at Windward have taught me more than all of my conventional education. I've done 'menial' programming tasks (porting code, testing, etc.), but mostly get to make decisions, and even put a feature into production. Windward gave me the experience needed to actually be able to get work done in a professional software development cycle.

PhoneSuite	June 2013 – January 2014
---

At PhoneSuite, I refined an existing database and helped properly implement Salesforce.com. It was an interesting mixture of administrative work of teaching people how to use a reasonably complex software, technical work with Salesforce, and experimenting with data analysis with and without Salesforce, projecting sales onto maps, and etc.  I also did various office tasks such as answering the phone.
